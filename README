LED lighting dimmer

My aim was to create a dimmer for a long LED stripe which would go around a big room. I didn't
want to output raw PWM and have around 20m of cable acting as antenna, even though the frequency
could be low and theoretically harmless. For that reason the circuit has two modules:

	1. PWM generator with ATtiny85 microcontroller, two MOSFETs and potentiometer input
	2. LC filter with cutoff frequency just a bit above 150Hz

The final output is flat voltage depending on the PWM duty cycle. There is possibility, however, to
bypass the filter.

I used DTP-24 ferrite powder ring choke, rated up to 6A. That limits the circuit to 72W output.
The main MOSFET allows even 12A of continuous output at 25Â°C, so the max power depends mostly on
the choke you choose.

TODO:
	* So far tested it with tiny load. Must see how it behaves with a few meters of LED stripe.
	* The table of potentiometer to PWM duty cycle translation is still far from perfect and fails
	  to provide linear dimming.
